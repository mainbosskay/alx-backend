# Pagination
This directory contains backend projects on Pagination.

The project will involve examining the following concepts:
- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## Requirements
The following requirements will be considered when handling these projects:

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
