# Caching
This directory contains backend projects on Caching.

The following concepts will be considered when managing the project:
- What a caching system is
- What FIFO means
- What LIFO means
- What LRU means
- What MRU means
- What LFU means
- What the purpose of a caching system
- What limits a caching system have

## Requirements
The following requirements will be taken into account when managing these projects:

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
